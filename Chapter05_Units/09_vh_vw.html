<body>
    <div class="container">
        This container is 50% wide and 100vh.<br>
        Because the parent container is by default the viewport, 100% would be the same as 100vw. in this case, 50% is
        the same as 50vw.<br>&nbsp;<br>
        All of the divs below are nested inside this one, but look how vw ignores its width.
        <div class="viewport pad">
            This div is 100vw and will overflow the yellow container.
        </div>
        <div class="vw80 pad">
            This div is 80Vw and will overflow the container.
        </div>
        <div class="percent pad">
            This div is 100% of the yellow container. It will scale inside the container.
        </div>
        <div class="percent50 pad">
            This div is 50% of the yellow container. It will scale inside the container.
        </div>
        <div class="vw50 pad">
            This div is 50Vw, the same as 100% because the container is 50%.<br>
            It scales with the viewport not the container.
        </div>
        Scale the viewport/browser width to see how they scale. The rate of change is the same because this container
        will always be 50% of the viewport.
    </div>
